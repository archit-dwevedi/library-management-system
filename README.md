# Low Level Design

Low-level design is a component-level design process that follows a step-by-step refinement process. This process can be used for designing data structures, required software architecture, source code and ultimately, performance algorithms.

### S.O.L.I.D. Principles

#### Single Responsibility Principle

> A class should have only one reason to change

#### Open/Closed Principle

> Class should be open for extensible and closed for modification

#### Liskov Substitution Principle

> Every sub-class/derived class should be substituatble for their base/parent class.

#### Interface Segregation Principle

> A class should not to be forced to implement the function which it doesn't use.

#### Dependency Inversion Principle

> Entities must depend upon abstraction not on concretions.
